        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2><script>"username()"</script></h2>
            <p>My name is John Chavez. I have three kids. An eight year old, a four year old, and a ten month old. </p>

            <p>I am unfortunately currently living in Florida (not a fan of the heat). I separated from the Air Force 
                in 2019 after five years of service as an Electrician. I've pretty much been working blue collar jobs 
                for most of my professional career. I'm currently an industrial mechanic for Wal-Mart Distribution Centers. </p>

            <p>I've done some college since I've been out of the Military but I'm not a fan of the pace and am more eager
                to get into a developer role. I want to finish my Degree once I've changed professions. </p>

            <p>A few fun facts about myself: I love coffee. I learned about a somewhat old school way of 
                making it on the stove top using a Moka Pot. </p>
